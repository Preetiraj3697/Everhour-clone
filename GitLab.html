                    <h4>When you connect GitLab with Everhour timesheet app, we will automatically sync your projects so that your team can start tracking time right away. No manual project setup required.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>2. Less employee teaching</h4>
                    <p>You don’t need to explain to your staff how to use additional employee time tracking software. Time tracking controls will appear right inside the GitLab interface, making it easy for them to track time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>3. Accuracy</h4>
                    <p>Employees often forget to track time as it's not convenient for them to switch between time clock app and project management app. Everhour eliminates these steps and improves time tracking accuracy.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>4. Estimates are always in front of you</h4>
                    <p>Everhour shows time vs. estimate beside task titles. When the entire team sees progress on tasks, they will hold you accountable for ensuring work is done.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>5. Automatic updates</h4>
                    <p>GitLab time tracking reports let you organize reported time using various information from your GitLab tasks such as tags, milestones, or custom fields. So you can dive deeper into tracked work hours analysis to get more accurate results.</p>

            <h1>How to track time in GitLab</h1>
            <h3>Step 1: Create an Everhour account</h3>
            <h3>Sign up for free and install our browser extension. This is how we embed controls into the GitLab interface. We support all popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.</h3>
            <h3>Step 2: Connect Everhour and GitLab</h3>
            <h3>After signup, Everhour will automatically sync all your projects. Sync happens periodically so all new projects that you create in GitLab will be visible in Everhour reports. Everhour also updates the names of tasks or projects if they were renamed in GitLab. This way Everhour reports will always show you the freshest data.</h3>
    

            <h3>Step 3: Invite your team</h3>
            <h3>You need to invite your team to join Everhour. They will also need to connect their GitLab accounts and install our browser extension. Only those you invite into Everhour will be able to track time and see time progress (not necessarily all GitLab users). Your clients or guests will not see anything in GitLab unless you invite them.</h3>
            <h3>Step 4: Track time inside GitLab</h3>
    
            <h3>You can track time using the timer or log time manually. You’ll see the time reported by each employee and its progress.</h3>
            
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/guides/gitlab-controls.webp" alt="">
            <h3>Step 5: Track time via the Everhour browser extension</h3>
            <h3>You don't necessarily need to open GitLab or Everhour website. By clicking on the timer icon in the browser toolbar you can quickly start the timer, add time to any task, edit time or estimate, and more.</h3>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/time-tracking-extension.webp" alt="">
            <h3>Step 6: Make custom reports with GitLab data</h3>
            <h3>There are a number of columns that show specific data coming from GitLab. Open GitLab time tracking report builder and select any of the columns to display the data in your report.</h3>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/guides/report-builder-v2.webp" alt="">
            <h3>Step 7: Find out more...</h3>
            <h3>Timers page shows what your team is doing right now. Timesheet page helps to view the structured picture of the time a member spent for a week. Timecard page displays when a user started their workday, when they had breaks and when they finished their work. Timeoff page shows all vacations, sick leaves, and any other PTO types.

I hate wasting time on complex software. Everhour just gets out of my way so I can get work done. Very responsive and helpful support! GitHub integration is fantastic and makes time tracking a lot easier and faster! I can build detailed reports of my work for clients. Exporting invoices directly to Freshbooks perfectly integrates my time tracking with my invoicing workflow. The app allows me to quickly start/stop timers when I forgot to do so on the web.”</p>
