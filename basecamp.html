            <h2>Does Basecamp have time tracking?</h2>
            <p>Many businesses love Basecamp. It offers a dime a dozen tools for effective project management and works perfectly even for the most complex projects. Yet, there is one simple component missing—a handy Basecamp time tracking feature. Everhour offers a neat solution to this issue—an intuitive and efficient time tracker extension that effortlessly integrates with Basecamp 2 and Basecamp 3.</p>
            <h2>How to track time in Basecamp with Everhour</h2>
            <p>A smoothly synced Everhour time tracking app with Basecamp 3 enables your project team with the advanced time tracking functionality close at hand. Here is how it works.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1: Create your Everhour accoun</h3>
                    <p> <a href="#"> Sign up</a> for free and install our browser extension. This is how we embed controls into the Basecamp interface. <a href="#">We support all popular browsers: Chrome,</a> Firefox, Safari, Edge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2: Connect Everhour and Basecamp</h3>
                    <p>When you sign up, Everhour will automatically sync tasks from your projects. Sync happens periodically so all <span> new tasks that you create in Basecamp will be visible in Everhour reports.</span> Everhour also updates the names of tasks or projects if they were renamed in Basecamp. This way Everhour reports will always show you the freshest data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3: Invite your team</h3>
                    <p>You need to invite your team to join Everhour. They will also need to connect their Basecamp accounts and install our browser extension. Only those you invite into Everhour will be able to track time and see time progress (not necessarily all Basecamp users). Your clients will not see anything in Basecamp unless you invite them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4: Use time tracking controls right in Basecamp</h3>
                    <p>After successful integration, you can track time using the timer or log time manually. You’ll see the time reported by each employee and its progress.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5: Track time via the Everhour browser extension</h3>
                <p>You don't necessarily need to open Basecamp or Everhour websites. By clicking on the timer icon in the browser toolbar you can quickly start the timer, add time to any task, edit time or estimate, and more.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/time-tracking-extension.webp" alt="">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 6: Make custom reports with Basecamp data</h3>
                <p>There are a number of columns that show specific data coming from Basecamp. Open a report builder and select any of the columns to display the data in your report. For example, group tasks by project showing members, reported time and original estimates. Or you can build a report with the total involvement of a specific department. Use this data to keep your customer informed and to make sure that your team moves according to your original estimates. By increasing transparency in the development process, you will increase the number of your satisfied customers.</p>
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 7: Find out more...</h3>
                <p>Everhour’s time tracker for Basecamp provides detailed statistics on working time. Use the Timers page to find out what your team is working on right now. Meanwhile, the Timesheet page will give you an overall view of the time your team members were spending during a week. The Timecards tab shows when each of your employees started their workday, what time did they take breaks, and when they finished working. The Timeoff page includes the data on all vacations, sick leaves, and other PTO types.

        <div><p>"I love how Everhour makes it easy to see how you're spending your time so you can adjust your schedule, redistribute your workload, etc. You can see exactly how long it takes you and your team to complete certain tasks and plan future projects accordingly. It integrates with Basecamp so all I have to do is press a little play button next to each of my to-dos and it tracks how long I'm spending. Then I can pull up a detailed report later to see where my time is going. It's been especially helpful when putting together the argument for additional team members."

            — Kate B. (Source: Capterra)</p> </div>
        <div><p>"Everhour allows our team to save time on time tracking! Everhour is the best time tracking tool for use with Basecamp. In the past, we have used Toggl and Tick and while they did integrate with Basecamp, it wasn't as seamless as it is with Everhour."

            — Kory L. (Source: Capterra)</p></div>
        <div><p>“I love Everhour's integration with Basecamp. My team can track their hours and I can pull all sorts of reporting for my agency. The custom reporting tool is my favorite. I can create multiple reports and share them with certain people so everyone gets the information they need on my leadership and billing team.”

            — Emily D. (Source: G2.com)</p></div>
        <div><p>“We use Everhour across our entire organization for time tracking. Not only do we use it for tracking client billable work, but we also use it for our internal projects and almost everything we do, so we can analyze how we spend our time and find ways to make everything more efficient. The integration with Basecamp is the most important feature for us.”

            — Tim H. (Source: TrustRadius)</p></div>
        <div><p>“We are a 15 people team working remotely from different cities of Latin America and Europe, and time tracking for each client, project, and task has been always a major issue. We’ve been using Everhour for the past year or so, and it has become an essential tool for our team. It does not only give us the ability to track how much time we have dedicated to a project, but also to estimate how much time a particular task will need in order to be completed next time and by who. Easily create and save reports with just a few clicks”

            — Daniel Y. (Source: TrustRadius)</p></div>
        <div><p>“Everhour has already paid for itself for the year by helping me track time I was missing in client projects. It is easy to use, has friendly customer service people, and the reports make it easy to invoice clients and track projects.”
