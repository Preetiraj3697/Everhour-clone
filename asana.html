        <div><p>“Everhour has the best integration with Asana compared to other time tracking tools — including Asana’s preferred integration (Harvest). And it’s not just because it’s more affordable than Harvest. With Harvest you have to click the icon in the task to start the time, then you have to set the project and task you want to track time for. That’s 3 additional clicks every time you want to track your time. With Everhour you just click your button to start your time. The product team at Everhour really gets UX here — their integration automatically pulls in all relevant data to your task including task name, section level, project, team, tags, literally everything available via the API! Imagine how useful having all that rich data can be if you want to report on things! No more settling for Asana’s weak and fluffy dashboard reports. With Everhour’s rich data you can export it into a data source to analyze or visualize in BI tools like DataStudio or Tableau.”

            — Skyler R. (Source: G2.com)</p> </div>
        <div><p>"Everhour is helping us figure out how much time we need to deliver our various services. This, in turn, helps us make better decisions and run our business better. The Asana integration is very useful and usable. It's terrific, for example, that timing on sub-tasks is summed up in the main task. Tracking time estimates against actual time worked is helping us figure out our capacity planning. The interface and tools are well-designed and generally easy to use. Everhour's value-for-money for features offered convinced us to make the move. It seemed to fit our needs better than Toggl."

            — Jeffrey M. (Source: Capterra)</p></div>
        <div><p>"Best time tracking software ever! Everhour's integration with Asana is seamless. More than that the reporting that you can do with it is insane. I now have accurate historical data on all my previous jobs to help me estimate future jobs more accurately. I love how staff billable hours are automatically pulled through to reports. Everhour helps keep track of my staff and how their time is allocated on projects. Since the time we spend on projects is essential for accurate quoting the time Everhour tracks is vital in keeping my business profitable."

            — Shaun D. (Source: G2.com)</p></div>
        <div><p>"I recently discovered that I can connect my Everhour with each of my client's Asana accounts and it has changed the game for my time tracking organization. I don't have to spend time creating tasks anymore because they are already created by the client in Asana! A project manager's dream."

            — Elizabeth V. (Source: G2.com)</p></div>
        <div><p>"I've been using Everhour for over a year and things have been great. I've used the major alternatives and Everhour is the most seamless to use with the most features. The ability to capture data directly from Asana and track time without having to define a project every time you need to do so is a huge time saver. The ability to also track budget based on whatever ways work best for your business model is fantastic as well (e.g. by cost, hours, billing, etc.). Everhour had a more seamless integration with Asana-even better than Asana's own native integration with Harvest. Everhour just works better and takes less effort/time."

            — Skyler R. (Source: Capterra)</p></div>
        <div><p>“As a remote-based company, we highly rely on task management tools such as Jira and Asana, and it's critical to control and gain knowledge on how we spend our time, and that's what is Everhour used for. Since we use two different tools, Jira for the tech team and Asana for the management team, we found in Everhour a very practical way to concentrate reporting regardless of the task management tools every member of the team uses."
