        <div><h5>1. Quick setup</h5><p>When you connect Todoist with Everhour <a>timesheet app</a>, we sync all your active projects and to-dos so that your team can start tracking time right away.<b>No manual project setup required.</b></p></div>
        <div><h5>2. Less employee teaching</h5><p>You don’t need to explain to your staff how to use additional<a> employee time tracking software.</a> Time tracking controls will<b> appear right inside the Todoist interface, </b>making it easy for them to track time.</p></div>
        <div><h5>3. Accuracy</h5><p>Employees often forget to track time as it's not convenient for them to switch between<a> time clock app </a> and the task management app. Everhour eliminates these steps and<b> improves time tracking accuracy.</b></p></div>
        <div><h5>4. Estimates are always in front of you</h5><p>Everhour shows time vs. estimate beside task titles. When the entire team sees progress on tasks, they will <b>hold you accountable for ensuring work is done.</b></p></div>
        <div><h5>5. Automatic updates</h5><p>When you add a new project or change the name of the existing to-dos in Todoist, we will sync this change automatically in Everhour. That means your<b> reports will always show the freshest data.</b></p></div>
        <div><h5>6. Detailed reports</h5><p>Todoist time tracking reports let you organize reported time using <b>various information from your Todoist to-dos </b> such as tags, sections, or custom fields. So you can dive deeper into <a>tracked work hours</a> analysis to get more accurate results.</p></div>

    <h1>How to track time in Todoist with Everhour</h1>
    <ul><li><strong>Step 1: Create an Everhour account</strong>
            <p><a>Sign up</a> for free and install our browser extension. This is how we embed controls into the Todoist interface. We<a> support all popular browsers:</a>Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Connect Everhour and Todoist</strong>
        <p>After signup, Everhour will automatically sync all your shared projects. Personal projects (not shared with anyone) won’t be synchronised by Everhour and time cannot be tracked for these projects. Sync happens periodically so all<b> new projects and to-dos that you create in Todoist will be visible in Everhour reports.</b> Everhour also updates the names of tasks or projects if they were renamed in Todoist.
             This way Everhour reports will always show you the freshest data.</p>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/guides/todoist-share-project.webp" alt=""></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Invite your team</strong>
        <p>You need to invite your team to join Everhour. They will also need to connect their Todoist accounts and install our browser extension. Only those you invite into Everhour will be able to <a>track time
             and attendance</a> and see time progress (not necessarily all Todoist users). Your clients or guests will not see anything in Todoist unless you invite them.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: Track time inside Todoist</strong>
        <p>You can track time using the timer or log time manually.
             You’ll see the time reported by each employee and its progress.</p>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/guides/todoist-controls.webp" alt=""></li>  
        <li><strong>Step 5: Track time via the Everhour browser extension</strong>
        <p>You don't necessarily need to open Todoist or Everhour website. By clicking on the timer icon in the browser
             toolbar you can quickly start the timer, add time to any task, edit time or estimate, and more.</p>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/time-tracking-extension.webp" alt=""></li> 
        <li><strong>Step 6: Make custom reports with Todoist data</strong>
        <p>There are a number of columns that show specific data coming from Todoist.
             Open Todoist time tracking report builder and select any of the columns to display the data in your report.</p>
            <img src="https://blog-cdn.everhour.com/assets/images/new-design/screens/guides/report-builder-v2.webp" alt=""></li>  
        <li><strong>Step 7: Find out more...</strong>
        <p>Timers page shows what your team is doing right now. Timesheet page helps to view the structured
             picture of the time a member spent for a week. Timecard page displays when a user started their workday, when they had breaks and when they finished their work.
             Timeoff page shows all vacations, sick leaves, and any other PTO types.</p>
