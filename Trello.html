                        <h4>1. Quick setup</h4>
                        <p>When you connect Trello with Everhour <a href="">timesheet app</a>, we will automatically sync your projects so that your team can start tracking time right away. <span class="a">No manual project setup required.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>2. Less employee teaching</h4>
                        <p>You don’t need to explain to your staff how to use additional <a href="">employee time tracking software.</a> Time tracking controls will <span class="a">appear right inside the GitLab interface,</span> making it easy for them to track time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>3. Accuracy</h4>
                        <p>Employees often forget to track time as it's not convenient for them to switch between <a href="">time clock app</a> and project management app. Everhour eliminates these steps and <span class="a">improves time tracking accuracy.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <p>Everhour shows time vs. estimate beside task and subtask titles. When the entire team sees progress, they will <span class="a">urge you to ensure the work is done.</span></p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>5. Automatic updates</h4>
                        <p>When you add a new project or change the name of the existing task in Trello, Everhour will sync this change automatically. That means your <span class="a">reports will always show the freshest data.</span></p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>6. Detailed reports</h4>
                        <p>Trello time tracking reports let you organize reported time using <span class="a">various information from your Trello tasks</span> such as tags, sections, or custom fields. So you can dive deeper into <a href="">tracked work hours</a> analysis to get more accurate results.</p>

We are using Everhour as a core business software because our business is to sell our time :) When you use such software, what you care about the most is speed, flexibility, ability to integrate with all major project management software.

The most interesting thing about Everhour is its integration with all major project management software. <span class="a">We are using Everhour with Asana and Trello and having a great experience with it.”</span> </p>

It was very useful to track how much time it takes for me to complete certain tasks under certain circumstances (urgent, regular, low-priority, etc) and then plan my days accordingly."

Real-time reports avoid the need to interrupt teammates asking about what they are working on, monthly and customs ones, help us in the finances area to decide payments or, in worth cases, penalties. It's great to see that the Everhour team keeps constantly working improving their service, frequent changes in the UI and workflow take you by surprise, sometimes it's scary but there are always some good decisions, new features, and improvements."</p>

Other companies wanted to also handle invoicing, project management, and other things. I already had a tool for those things; what I needed was an easy and enjoyable to use time tracking solution that I knew would work. Everhour has consistently impressed me with how well their product works and how fast they innovate and improve."</p>
